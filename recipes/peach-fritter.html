                <p>Making fresh peach fritters with chunks of peaches in a peach batter instead of chunks of peaches in a plain batter changes everything. These fritters are pure peach goodness. Serve with vanilla ice cream and an optional Bourbon whiskey simple syrup.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 generous cup cubed fresh peach (about 1 very large, or 2 small peaches)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add cubed peaches to a bowl and toss well with 2 tablespoons sugar. Coverand let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Peaches will release their juice and a syrup will form at the bottom of the bowl. </li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Stir vanilla extract, nutmeg, cinnamon, and panko breadcrumbs into peaches. Add self-rising flour and stir until batter is no longer dry or sticky but fully moistened, about 1 minute. Rest batter for 3 to 5 minutes before frying. </li>
                <li>Transfer 6 heaping spoonfuls of batter into the hot oil, and fry for 90 seconds. Carefully tip fritters over to the other side and fry 90 seconds more. Flip again, and cook 1 minute more. </li>
                <li>Remove to cool on a rack until just barely warm.</li>
                <li>To make Bourbon syrup, combine 1/4 cup sugar, water, and Bourbon in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil for 1 minute, and remove from heat. Cool to room temperature. (You can make syrup ahead and refrigerate until needed. This is a very light syrup, so if you want something a little thicker you can boil for an extra minute.)</li>
                <li>Serve fritters with vanilla ice cream and Bourbon syrup.</li>
